# ArangoPanel

This repository contains a Foxx microservice called **acid-panel**. The service provides a visual interface for creating ArangoDB collections and schemas using pure HTML and JavaScript. All files are static and can be installed directly in ArangoDB without build steps.

Mount the service under `/acid-panel` and open the interface to create collections with field definitions, Joi validations and relations.
